## Flight API: [https://github.com/barkmanr/FlightAPI](https://github.com/barkmanr/FlightAPI) <br/>
### Enterprise Software Exam Project
This project was completed under a 2-hour time limit and involves building an API that serves as a database for flight data. The API allows clients to interact with the data by providing three key features: listing all available flights, adding new flights, and searching for flights at specific locations.

To ensure smooth interaction, the project utilizes Swagger for testing the API endpoints and inspecting the responses. The data is managed through DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), which help control the amount of data exposed in each request for security and efficiency.

The client interacts with the API via a local address, receiving data in JSON format with HTTP Response Message structures. Additionally, the API includes user authentication using identity management. Only authenticated users are authorized to add new flights, ensuring controlled access to this functionality.

## Top Baby Names Sorter:
[https://github.com/barkmanr/Barkmanr.SortingBabyNames](https://github.com/barkmanr/Barkmanr.SortingBabyNames) <br/>
Reads text files of the top baby names of a specific year. Formtat of text file is like this "(1	Jacob	21,196	Isabella	22,316)". The way it reads the file is by reading each line of text and then seperating each item by spaces. For the numbers it just seperates it by the comma. Three things this does is ask for a name, gender, and year; and it will give you the rank of it if in top 1000. Then it will get all the names that apear in both list. The last thing it does is show the top 10 unique names that the female and male names have.
